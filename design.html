						<h4 class="designparagraph"> We first researched what brands that offer similiar product and service (clothes and online shopping) do on their website. Based on our finding we conducted <em>User Testing Interviewsa</em> which aided us in constructig our website.</h4> 
						<h3 class="designparagraphs2"> We decided to use the basic layout we initially drafted because it was proven during the User Testing that it is easy to understand at first glance. We wanted our site to have a sense of unity and to achieve this we used a continuation of specific elements throughout each page of the website: header with the brand name, navigation bar with menu and the logo and a footer with links to our social media accounts. And by having the same colour palette and always having the first container of each page be with the same colour -  we wanted to establish a rhythm throughout the website.<br>Having a header and footer element also made the site seem balanced because they provided a symmetrical view that was also aided by the use of containers inside containers which allowed us to mimic the effect of "white space".<br> To establish hierarchy we used different sizes of the containers (boxes) around the website - the larger elements contain the main points of the page's content.<br> Another design element we utilized was contrasting light and dark colours for our text.<br></h3>

						  <h4>Our main concern in regards to creating our website was to make sure the layout was easy to use and understandable for our target group. To ensure this we conducted three user testing interviews with our low-fidelity prototype (created with Adobe XD).<br><br><b>The interviews followed the same scenario:</b><br><em>1.	What do you think of the layout?<br>2.	How do you find the navigation process around the site?<br>3.Can you purchase a product? (no instruction were further provided after giving the task)<br>4.	Additional remarks.</em><br><br><b>User Tester 1, 23-years-old:</b><br> The tester found the layout familiar as he has seen it before on other websites but also pointed out that it appears static because of the sharp edges of the elements. The user liked the banner and found its content understandable and straightforward. They found it easy to navigate around the website with the navigation bar element. After receiving the mission of purchasing a product they accomplished it in less than a minute and commented afterwards that it was an easy and familiar process. They commented at the end that they like brands that establish a clear and recognizable identity. <br><b>User Tester2,22-years-old:</b><br> The tester commented about the layout that it looks nice and it is simple thus easy to understand. They found the navigation around the website to effortless and simplistic. After the mission of purchasing a product was given the user managed to complete it quickly and without any difficulties. They commented afterwards that it was simple and easy to do. The tester did not have any comments for us but they suggested the shopping cart – to have a number indicator to see how many items you have. <br><b>User Tester 3, 21-years-old:</b><br>The tester immediately noticed the shopping cart and realized that this was a website offering products. They found the layout to be standard and similar to other webshops. The user commented that navigating around the website was simple and because of the navigation bar’s tabs – understandable. They quickly accomplished the mission of purchasing a product and mentioned that it was easy and felt familiar because its concept is the same as other webshop brands. They remarked about wanting to have a “go back/cancellation”  option so if they change their mind about a product and not wanting it anymore they can quickly and easily do that. <br><br>All of our testers found our layout simple and easy to understand, which is the reason why we kept it for our final execution. But we added paddings to the edges of he containers as to avoid the static pperance mentioned by "User Tester 1". The tester’s were all successful in going around the website and pointed out that they like how the navigation is everywhere on the website and it contains everything that the website offers. <br>They all managed to “purchase a product” and were satisfied with the easiness of the process. <br>In conclusion, based on our results from the user testing interviews we kept our initial layout and flowchart, but we made the edges of the boxes (containers) a bit softer by either removing the border color or using a padding in the styling. We also took into account their suggestions for our content mainly placing visuals, create a string and clear identity - be transperant about our brand's mission and values; and being more transparent about our products. </h4>
